                Non-Invasive Brain Stimulation (NIBS) is an umbrella term used for any mechanism which stimulates the brain non-invasively. Among them, Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) is a technique for noninvasive stimulation of the human brain where the stimulation is produced by generating a brief, high-intensity magnetic field by passing a brief electric current through a magnetic coil. TMS can be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Single pulse TMS is used for diagnostic, however, rTMS is used for therapeutic either by facilitating or inhibiting the brain area. Here, I will talk about our research group’s work on TMS in stroke rehabilitation.

                There is a close association between mood, the circadian system and sleep regulation. Sleep is necessary for normal functioning of the brain during the wake state and disrupted sleep is a core feature of many psychiatric diseases including major depressive disorder (MDD). Moreover, chronic stress has detrimental effects on sleep. We assessed the link between stress and sleep in mice using a chronic social defeat stress (CSDS) paradigm. Stress-susceptible mice displayed increased fragmentation of Non-Rapid Eye Movement (NREM) sleep both pre- and post-stress. Moreover, we found that stress susceptible mice exhibited: (i) blunted diurnal rhythms in activity in neural circuits that may play a role in regulating daily rhythms in mood and (ii) decreased rate of photoentrainment. Our findings emphasized an interaction between stressed induced mood disorders, circadian rhythms and sleep.

               Interaction between mother and infant is the earliest and most critical social relationship in mammalians. Specific automatic brain patterns regulate infants seeking proximity to mother and prompt protest on separation from mother. These mechanisms promote bonding through physiological, hormonal and behavioral communications. Reciprocally, enhanced brain activity in caregivers is associated with increase in movement and speech to infants and, more generally, with their propensity to nurture. Infant and maternal brains “respond” to one another, and they follow a dynamic synchronous “dance”. During the seminar, I will illustrate these mother-infant dynamics with new findings from animal and human studies that employ a variety of techniques from genetic engineering to neuroimaging hyper-scanning.
